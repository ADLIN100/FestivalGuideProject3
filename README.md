# project overview

For Project 3, I chosen my festival is an interactive event called the “Inspiring Asian Athletes Fest,” a three-day sports event celebrating Asian American athletes from various colleges. 
The event is for sports fans, college students, and supporters of Asian American representation in athletics, the guide provides essential information about event schedules, guest spaker of athletes, and venue details for attendees navigating the showcase at Chase Center and Oracle Park. 
By combining comprehensive event information with a visually dynamic layout, the guide creates an engaging and accessible experience that enhances audience connection to the event and its mission.

The purpose of this festival is to foster a sense of community and pride by spotlighting the athletic achievements of Asian American college athletes. 
In an industry where Asian American athletes are often underrepresented, this event serves as an empowering platform that encourages young athletes and inspires pride among community members.
